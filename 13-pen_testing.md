## Pen Testing

### Security Audit

* Policy and procedure focused
* Tests whether organization is following specific standards and policies

### Vulnerability Assessment

* Scans and tests for vulnerabilities but does **not intentionally exploit them**

#### Product-Based Solutions

Product-based solutions are installed in the organization's internal network. They are installed in a private or non-routable space, or the Internet-addressable portion of an organization's network. If they are installed in the private network or, in other words, behind the firewall, they cannot always detect outside attacks.

#### Service-Based Solutions

Service-based solutions are offered by third parties, such as auditing or security consulting firms. Some solutions are hosted inside the network; others are hosted outside the network. A drawback of this solution is that attackers can audit the network from outside.

#### Tree-Based Assessment

In a tree-based assessment, the auditor selects different strategies for each machine or component of the information system. This approach relies on the administrator to provide a starting shot of intelligence, and then to start scanning continuously without incorporating any information found at the time of scanning.

#### Inference-Based Assessment

In an inference-based assessment, scanning starts by building an inventory of protocols found on the machine. After finding a protocol, the scanning process starts to detect which ports are attached to services. After finding services, it selects vulnerabilities on each machine and starts to execute only those relevant tests.

### Penetration Testing

* Looking for vulnerabilities and **actively seeking to exploit them**
* Need to make sure you have a great contract in place to protect you from liability
* Clearly defined, full scale test of security controls

#### Phases of Pen Testing

* **Pre-Attack Phase**: reconnaissance and data-gathering
  * Planning and preparation: Rule of Engagement \(RoE\)
  * Methodology design
  * Network information gathering
* **Attack Phase**: attempts to penetrate the network and execute attacks
  * Penetrating perimeter
  * Acquiring target
  * Escalating privileges
  * Execution, implantation, retracting
* **Post-Attack Phase**: cleanup to return a system to the pre-attack condition and deliver reports
  * Reporting
  * Clean-up
  * Artifact destruction

#### Types of Pen Testing

* **Black Box**: without any knowledge of the system or network
* **White Box**: complete knowledge of the system
* **Gray Box**: some knowledge of the system and/or network
* **External Assessment**: analyzing publicly available information; conducting network scanning, enumeration and testing from the network perimeter
* **Internal Assessment**: performed from within the organization, from various network access points

#### Teams

* **Red Team**: attacking
* **Blue Team**: defending
* **Purple Team**: doing both attacking and defending

#### Automated Testing Tools

* **Metasploit**: framework for developing and executing code against a remote target machine
* **Core Impact Pro**: best known, all-inclusive automated testing framework, tests everything from web applications and individual systems to network devices and wireless
* **CANVAS**: hundreds of exploits, automated exploitation system and extensive exploit development framework
