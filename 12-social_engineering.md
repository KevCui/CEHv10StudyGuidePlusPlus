## Social Engineering

* The art of manipulating a person or group into providing information or a service they would otherwise not have given

### Social Engineering Phases

1. Research \(dumpster dive, visit websites, tour the company, etc.\)
2. Select the victim \(identify frustrated employee or other target\)
3. Develop a relationship
4. Exploit the relationship \(collect sensitive information\)

### Reasons This Works

* Human nature \(trusting others\)
* Ignorance of social engineering efforts
* Fear \(of consequences of not providing the information\)
* Greed \(promised gain for providing requested information\)
* A sense of moral obligation

### Human-Based Attacks

* Always be pleasant because it gets more information

#### Impersonation

* Pretending to be someone you're not
* Can be anything from a help desk person up to an authoritative figure \(FBI agent\)
* Posing as a tech support professional can really quickly gain trust with a person
* **Vishing** Voice or VoIP phishing: an impersonation technique in which attacker uses Voice over IP \(VoIP\) technology to trick individuals into revealing their personal information

#### Eavesdropping

* Listening in on conversations about sensitive information

#### Shoulder Surfing

* Looking over someone's shoulder to get info
* Can be done long distance with binoculars, etc.

#### Dumpster Diving

* Looking for sensitive information in the trash
* Shredded papers can sometimes indicate sensitive info
* Passive activity

#### Reverse Social Engineering

* Getting someone to call you and give information
* Often happening with tech support, eg: an email is sent to user stating they need them to call back due to technical issue
* Involved techniques: **Sabotage**, **Marketing**, and **Support**

#### Piggybacking

* Attacker pretends that badge is lost and attacker asks someone to hold/open the door, **with consent** of the authorized person

#### Tailgating

* Attacker has a fake badge and walks in behind someone who has a valid one, **without consent** of the authorized person

#### Rubber-hose Attack

* Extracting secrets from people by use of torture or coercion

### Computer-Based Attacks

* Can begin with sites like Facebook where information about a person is available

#### Pop-Up Windows

* Hoax letters: warns the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat
* Chain letters: offers free gifts
* Instant Chat Messenger: chats via instant chat messages to gather personal information
* Spam Emails

#### Phishing

* Crafting an email that appears legitimate but contains links to fake websites or to download malicious content
* **Ways to Avoid Phishing**
  * Beware unknown, unexpected or suspicious originators
  * Beware of who the email is addressed to
  * Verify phone numbers
  * Beware bad spelling or grammar
  * Always check links

**Spear Phishing**

* Targeting a person or a group with a phishing attack
* Can be more useful because attack can be targeted

**Whaling**

* Going after CEOs or other C-level executives

**Pharming**

* Use of malicious code that redirects a user's traffic
* 2 ways to perform:
  * DNS Cache Poisoning
  * Host File Modification

**Spimming \(Spam over Instant Messaging\)**

* Using IM as a tool to spread spam

#### Fake Antivirus

* Pretending to be an anti-virus but is a malicious tool
* Very prevalent attack

#### Mail Relaying

* Bouncing e-mail from internal to external mails servers continuously
* Ensuring that no one knows they sent the spam out to thousands of users at a time

#### Watering hole

* The victim is of a particular group \(organization, industry, or region\)
* Attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often uses and infects one or more of them with malware. Eventually, some member of the targeted group becomes infected
* Looking for specific information may only attack users coming from a specific IP address

#### Baitting attack

* Attacker leaves malware-infected floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or USB flash drives in locations people will find them, give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and waits for victims

### Mobile-Based Attacks

* Publishing malicious apps
* Repackaging legitimate apps
* Fake security applications
* **SMiShing**: SMS Phishing

### Insider Threats

#### Insiders

* Privileged Users: most trusted employees of the company
* Disgruntled Employees: unhappy employees or contract workers
* Terminated Employees
* Accident-Prone Employees: accidentally losing device or sending email to incorrect recipients... which leads to unintentional data disclosure
* Third Parties
* Undertrained Staff: trusted employee becomes an unintentional insider due to lack of cybersecurity training

#### Types of Threats

* Malicious insider: disgruntled or terminated employees who steal data or destroy company networks intentionally by injecting malware to corporate network
* Negligent Insider: uneducated on potential security threats, more vulnerable to social engineering attacks
* Professional Insider: most harmful insider, using technical knowledge to identify weakness and vulnerability of company's network and sell confidential information
* Compromised Insider: outsider compromises insider having access to critical assets of an organization
