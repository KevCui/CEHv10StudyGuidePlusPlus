## Sniffing and Evasion

### Sniffing

* Capturing packets as they pass on the wire to review for interesting information
* Sniffers operate at OSI Layer 2, upper layers won't be aware of sniffing because OSI layers are designed independently of each other,
* **Passive sniffing**: watching network traffic without interaction; only works for same collision domain, like sniffing through a hub
* **Active sniffing**: using methods to make a switch send traffic to you even though it isn't destined for your machine, like sniffing through a switch-based network

#### Basic Knowledge

**NIC \(Network Interface Card\)**

* Many wireless NICs have bad support for monitor mode in Windows. Catching general traffic is ok but not controlling packets
* **Promiscuous mode**: NIC must be in this setting to look at all frames passing on the wire
* **Collision Domains**
  * Traffic from your NIC, regardless of mode, can only be seen within the same collision domain
  * Switch has a collision domain for each port
  * Hub has one collision domain by default

**MAC \(Media Access Control\)**

* Physical or burned-in address
* Assigned to NIC for communications at the Data Link layer
* 48 bits long, displayed as 12 hex characters separated by colons
  * First half of address is the **organizationally unique identifier**, identifying manufacturer
  * Second half ensures no two cards on a subnet will have the same address

**ARP \(Address Resolution Protocol\)**

* Resolves IP address to a MAC address
* Sending a request packet to all the network elements, asking for the MAC address from a specific IP
* Working on a broadcast basis, both requests and replies are broadcast to everyone
* Broadcast destination MAC address: `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`
* Packets are `ARP_REQUEST` and `ARP_REPLY`
* Stateless, each computer maintains its own ARP cache, which can be poisoned
* ARP command
  * Display current ARP cache: `arp -a`
  * Clear ARP cache: `arp -d *`

**IPv6**

* 128-bit address \(0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 4x8+7=39 digits\), 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits
* Sections with all 0s are shorted to nothing, just having start and end colons
* Double colon can be used only once
* Loopback address is `::1`

| IPv6 Address Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unicast | Addressed and intended for one host interface |
| Multicast | Addressed for multiple host interfaces |
| Anycast | Large number of hosts can receive; nearest host opens |

| IPv6 Scopes | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Link local | Applies only to hosts on the same subnet \(Address block fe80::/10\) |
| Site local | Applies to hosts within the same organization \(Address block fec0::/10\) |
| Global | Includes everything |

* Scope applies for multicast and anycast
* Traditional network scanning is **computationally less feasible**

**Protocols Susceptible**

* SMTP is sent in plain text and is viewable over the wire, until SMTPv3 which limits the information you can get, but you can still see it
* SNMP community string, like user id or password
* FTP, TFTP, IMAP, POP3, NNTP \(Network News Transfer Protocol\) and HTTP all send over clear text data
* TCP shows sequence numbers, usable in session hijacking
* TCP and UCP show open ports
* IP shows source and destination addresses
* Telnet and Rlogin show keystrokes including user names and passwords sent in cleartext

#### SPAN port \(Switched Port Analyzer\)

* Also known as **Port Mirroring**
* A Cisco switch feature, switch configuration that makes the switch send a copy of all frames from other ports to a specific port
* Not all switches have the ability to do this
* Only listen
* Modern switches sometimes don't allow SPAN ports to send data

#### Wiretapping/Telephone tapping

* **Active**: alerting or affecting the communication
* **Passive**: only monitoring or recording the traffic
* **Lawful interception**: legally intercepting communications between two parties for surveillance

#### MAC Flooding

* Switches either flood or forward data
* If a switch doesn't know what MAC address is on a port, it will flood the data until it finds out
* MAC Flooding by sending so many MAC addresses to the CAM table that it can't keep up
* MAC Flooding will often destroy the switch before you get anything useful, doesn't last long to get noticed
* Most modern switches protect against this
* **CAM Table**
  * The table on a switch that stores which MAC address is on which port
  * If table is empty or full, everything is sent to all ports
* Tool: Macof

#### Switch port stealing

* Using MAC flooding to sniff packets
* Flooding switch with forged gratuitous ARP packets with target MAC as source, and attacker's MAC as destination
* A race condition of attacker's flooded packets and target host packets will occur, switch has to change MAC address binding constantly

#### DHCP Starvation \(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\)

* Attempting to exhaust all available addresses from the server, denial-of-service attack
* Attacker sends so many requests that the address space allocated is exhausted
* DHCPv4 packets: DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPACK
* DHCPv6 packets: Solicit, Advertise, Request \(Confirm, Renew, Rebind\), Reply
* **DHCP Steps**
  1. Client sends DHCPDISCOVER
  2. Server responds with DHCPOFFER
  3. Client sends request for IP with DHCPREQUEST
  4. Server sends address and config via DHCPACK
* Tool: Yersinia
* **Rogue DHCP Server Attack**: setup to offer addresses instead of real server. Can be combined with starvation to real server
* Countermeasures
  * To counter DHCP starvation, ussing port security to limit max. number of MAC addresses on switch
  * To counter rogue DHCP server attack, configuring DHCP snooping: `ip dhcp snooping`

#### ARP Poisoning

* Also called **ARP spoofing** or **gratuitous ARP responses**
* Using special packet to update ARP cache even without a request, used to poison cache on other machines
* Changing the cache of machines so that packets are sent to the attacker instead of the intended target
* Can trigger alerts because of the constant need to keep updating the ARP cache of machines
* **Countermeasures**
  * Permanently adding Default gateway MAC into each machine's cache
  * Using Dynamic ARP Inspection \(DAI\), DHCP snooping database to prevent MITM
  * Using XArp to detect ARP attacks
* Tools
  * Cain and Abel
  * Ufasoft Snif
  * dsniff

#### STP \(Spanning Tree Protocol\) attack

* Attacker has access to switch ports that are able to become trunk ports, then introduce a rogue switch spanning tree priority into the network
* Countermeasure: loop protection

#### Spoofing

* **MAC Spoofing**
  * An address-based authentication attack, changes your MAC address. Benefit is CAM table uses most recent address
  * Making switch send all packets to your address instead of the intended one until the CAM table is updated with the real address again
  * Port security allows traffic from a specific MAC address to enter to a port
  * Port security can slow this down, but doesn't always stop it
  * A security feature on switches that allows an administrator to manually assign MAC addresses to a specific port
  * Spoofing Tool: Technitium MAC Address Changer
  * **Countermeasures**
    * DHCP Snooping Binding Table: filters untrusted DHCP messages
    * Dynamic ARP Inspection
    * IP Source Guard: security feature in switch that restricts IP traffic on untrusted Layer 2 ports by filtering traffic based on DHCP snooping binding database
    * Encryption: encrypting communication between AP and computer
    * Retrieval of MAC Address: retrieving MAC address from NIC directly instead of from OS
    * Implementation of IEEE 802.1X suites: Port-based Network Access Control \(PNAC\), enforces access control when user joins the network
    * AAA \(Authentication, Authorization, Accounting\): using AAA server mechanism in order to filter MAC addresses subsequently
* **IRDP \(Internet Router Discovery Protocol\) Spoofing**
  * Attacker sends ICMP Router Discovery Protocol messages advertising a malicious gateway
  * Passive sniffing, MITM, DoS
  * **Countermeasure**: disables IRDP on hosts
* **DNS Poisoning/Spoofing**
  * Changing where machines get their DNS information from, allowing attacker to redirect to malicious websites
  * **DNS Cache Poisoning**: allowing attacker to replace IP address entries for a target site on a given DNS server with IP address of the server he/she controls
  * **DNSSEC**: helping prevent DNS poisoning by encrypting records

#### IP Spoofing Detection Techniques

* **Direct TTL Probes**
  * Sending packet to host of suspect spoofed packet that triggers reply and compare TTL with suspect packet
  * TTL in the reply is not as the same as the packet being checked, it's a spoofed packet
  * This technique is successful when the attacker is in a different subnet from that of the victim
* **IP Identification Number**
  * Sending probe to host of suspect spoofed traffic that triggers reply and compare the IP ID with suspect traffic
  * IP IDs are not close in value to the packet being checked, suspect traffic is spoofed
  * This technique is deemed successful even if the attacker is in the same subnet
* **TCP Flow Control Method**
  * Attackers sends spoofed TCP packets, will not receive the target's SYN-ACK packets
  * Attackers cannot therefore be responsive to change in the congestion window size
  * When received traffic continues after a window size is exhausted, most probably the packets are spoofed

#### Wireshark

* Previously known as Ethereal
* Can be used to follow streams of data
* Can also filter the packets by specific packet type or specific source address, for example:
  * Filter out the noise from ARP, DNS and ICMP requests: `! (arp or icmp or dns)`
  * Display HTTP GET requests: `http.request`
  * Display TCP segments that contain the word _string_: `tcp contains string`
  * Display telnet packets containing that IP: `ip.addr==172.17.15.12 && tcp.port==23`
  * Display TCP requests with ACK flag set: `tcp.flags==0x16`
  * Display all TCP connections with SYN packets: `tcp.flags.syn==1`

#### tcpdump

* Recent version is WinDump \(for Windows\)
* `tcpdump [flag] [interface]`
* Put the interface in listening mode: `tcpdump -i eth1 <ip>`
* `-n` flag to not perform DNS resolution on IP addresses
* `tcptrace` can be used to analyze tcpdump file

#### Other Sniffing Tools

* Ettercap: also can be used for MITM attacks, ARP poisoning. Has active and passive sniffing
* Snort: usually discussed as an Intrusion Detection application
* SteelCentral Packet Analyzer
* Capsa Network Analyzer
* OmniPeek
* Observer Analyzer
* Wi.cap. Network Sniffer Pro: mobile network packet sniffer for ROOT ARM droids
* Packet Capture: network traffic sniffer app with SSL decryption

### Evasion

#### IDS \(Intrusion Detection System\)

* Hardware or software devices that examine streams of packets for malicious behavior

**Types of IDS**

* **Signature based**: comparing packets against a list of known traffic patterns
* **Anomaly based**: making decisions on alerts based on learned behavior and "normal" patterns
* **HIDS** \(Host-based intrusion detection system\): examining specific host-based actions, such as what applications are being used, what files are being accessed and what information resides in the kernel logs
* **NIDS** \(Network-based intrusion detection system\): scanning network traffic, do not use host system resources
* **NBA** \(Network behavior analysis\): examining network traffic to identify threats that generate unusual traffic flows
* **Snort**: a widely deployed IDS that is open source
  * Runs in three different modes
    * **Sniffer Mode**: watching packets in real time
    * **Packet Logger Mode**: saving packets to disk for review at a later time
    * **NIDS Mode**: analyzing network traffic against various rule sets
  * Syntax
    * Alert about traffic coming not from an external network to the internal one on port 31337:

      ```text
      alert tcp !HOME_NET any -> $HOME_NET 31337 (msg : "BACKDOOR ATTEMPT-Backorifice")
      ```

    * Example output:

      ```text
      10/19-14:48:38.543734 0:48:542:2A:67 -> 0:10:B5:3C:34:C4 type:0x800 len:0x5EA
      **xxx -> xxx TCP TTL:64 TOS:0x0 ID:18112 IpLen:20 DgmLen:1500 DF**
      ```

**Types of Alerts**

* **True Positive** \(Attack - Alert\): activity was an attack, IDS identifies as an attack
* **False Positive** \(No Attack - Alert\): activity was acceptable, but IDS identifies as an attack
* **False Negative** \(Attack - No Alert\): activity was an attack, but IDS identifies as an acceptable behavior
* **True Negative** \(No Attack - No Alert\): activity was acceptable, IDS identifies as an acceptable behavior

#### IPS \(Intrusion Prevention System\)

* Identifying malicious activity, logs information about this activity, reports it and attempts to block or stops it

**Types of IPS**

* **NIPS** \(Network-based intrusion prevention system\): monitoring the entire network for suspicious traffic by analyzing protocol activity
* **HIPS** \(Host-based intrusion prevention system\): an installed software package which monitors a single host for suspicious activity by analyzing events occurring within that host
* **WIPS** \(Wireless intrusion prevention system\): monitoring a wireless network for suspicious traffic by analyzing wireless networking protocols

#### Firewall

* An appliance within a network protects internal resources from unauthorized access
* Only uses rules that **implicitly denies** traffic unless it is allowed
* Often uses **network address translation** \(NAT\) which can apply a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship between external and internal IP addresses
* **Bastion Host**: hosts on the screened subnet designed to protect internal resources, using the concept "separation of duties"
* **Screened Subnet**: DMZ, hosts all public-facing servers and services
* **Private zone**: hosts internal hosts that only respond to requests from within that zone
* **Multi-homed**: firewall that has 2 or more interfaces

**Firewall Technologies**

| OSI | Firewall Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| 7 | VPN, Application Proxies |
| 6 | VPN |
| 5 | VPN, Circuit-level Gateway |
| 4 | VPN, Packet Filtering |
| 3 | VPN, NAT, Packet Filtering, Stateful Multilayer Inspection |
| 2 | VPN, Packet Filtering |
| 1 | Not Applicable |

**Types of Firewall**

* **Packet-filtering**: only looking at packet headers \(IP address, packet type and port number\), layer 3 Network
* **Circuit-level gateway**: checking TCP handshake, does not filer individual packets, firewall that works on layer 5 Session
* **Application-level gateway**: working like a proxy, allowing specific services in and out, WAF, layer 7 Application
* **Stateful inspection**: combining above 3 types of firewalls, dynamic packet filtering, firewalls that track the entire status of a connection

#### Honeypot

* A system setup as a decoy to entice attackers, to research attack methodologies
* Should not include too many open services or look too easy to attack
* **High interaction**: actually running all services and applications and is designed to be completely compromised
* **Medium interaction**: simulating a real OS, applications and its services
* **Low interaction**: simulating a number of services and cannot be completely compromised
* Examples
  * Specter
  * Honeyd
  * KFSensor

#### Evasion Techniques

* **Fragmentation**: splitting up packets so that the IDS can't detect the real intent, `nmap -f`
* **Time-To-Live Attack** \(TTL\)
  * Each router along a data path decrements TTL by 1
  * TTL reaches 0, package is dropped
  * Attacker has a prior knowledge of topology of target network, in order to calculate TTL
  * Breaking traffic to fragments, eg: Frag 1, Frag 2, Frag 3
  * Sending fragments as below as an exmaple:

    ```text
    Attacker          NIDS             Router    Victim
    Frag 1        ->  Frag 1            ->       Frag 1
    Frag 2, TTL=1 ->  Frag 1, 2        Dropped   Frag 1, Waiting 2
    Frag 3        ->  Frag 1, 2, 3      ->       Frag 1, 3 Waiting 2
                    False Reassembly
    Real Frag 2   ->  Frag 2            ->       Frag 1, 2, 3, Correct Reassembly
    ```
* **Slow down**: faster scanning such as using nmap's -T5 switch will get you caught. Pros use -T1 switch to get better results
* **Unicode encoding**: working with web requests - using Unicode characters instead of ascii can sometimes get past
* **Network flooding**: triggering alerts that aren't your intended attack so that confuses firewalls/IDS and network admins
* **Insertion Attack**: confusing IDS by forcing it to read invalid packets
* **Spoofing**: can only be used when you don't expect a response back to your machine
* **Source routing**: specifying the path a packet should take on the network; most systems don't allow this anymore
* **IP Address Decoy**: sending packets from your IP as well as multiple other decoys to confuse the IDS/Firewall as to where the attack is really coming from
  * `nmap -D RND:10 x.x.x.x`
  * `nmap -D decoyIP1,decoyIP2....,sourceIP,.... [target]`
* **Proxy**
  * Hiding true identity by filtering through another computer
  * Also can be used for other purposes such as content blocking evasion, etc
  * **Proxy chains**: chains multiple proxies together
    * Proxy Switcher
    * Proxy Workbench
    * ProxyChains
* **Tor**
  * A specific type of proxy that uses multiple hops to a destination
  * Endpoints are peer computers
* **Anonymizers**: hiding identity on HTTP traffic \(port 80\)
* Tools
  * Nessus: also a vulnerability scanner
  * ADMutate: creating scripts not recognizable by signature files
  * Whisker: session Splicing

**Firewall Evasion**

* **Firewalking**: going through every port on a firewall to determine what is open
* Firewall type can be discerned by banner grabbing
* The best way around a firewall will always be a compromised internal machine
* **HTTP tunneling**: crafting port 80 segments to carry a payload for protocols the firewall may have, then on other end \(internal machine\) to pull the payload out of all those 80 packets
