## Security in Cloud Computing

### Cloud Computing Basics

#### Characteristics

* On-demand self service
* Distributed storage
* Rapid elasticity
* Automated management
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Measure service: pay-per-use
* Virtualization technology

#### Limitations

* Organizations have limited control and flexibility
* Prone to outages and other technical issues
* Security, privacy, and compliance issues
* Contracts and lock-ins
* Depending on network connections

#### Three Types of Cloud Computing Services

| On-Premises | IasS | PasS | SaaS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| App |  |  | x |
| Data |  |  | x |
| Runtime |  | x | x |
| Middleware |  | x | x |
| O/S |  | x | x |
| Virtualization | x | x | x |
| Servers | x | x | x |
| Storage | x | x | x |
| Networking | x | x | x |

**IaaS \(Infrastructure as a Service\)**

* Providing virtualized computing resources
* Third party hosts the servers with hypervisor running the VMs as guests
* Subscribers usually pay on a per-use basis

**PaaS \(Platform as a Service\)**

* Geared towards software development
* Hardware and software hosted by provider
* Providing ability to develop without having to worry about hardware or software

**SaaS \(Software as a Service\)**

* Provider supplies on-demand applications to subscribers
* Offloading the need for patch management, compatibility and version control

#### Deployment Models

* **Public Cloud**: services provided over a network that is open for public to use
* **Private Cloud**: cloud solely for use by one single tenant; usually done in larger organizations
* **Community Cloud**: cloud shared by several organizations, but not open to public
* **Hybrid Cloud**: a composition of two or more cloud deployment models

#### NIST Cloud Architecture

* **Cloud Consumer**: acquiring and uses cloud products and services
* **Cloud Provider**: purveyor of products and services
* **Cloud Carrier**: organization with responsibility of transferring data; akin to power distributor for electric grid
* **Cloud Auditor**: performing independent examination of cloud service control
* **Cloud Broker**: managing use, performance and delivery of services as well as relationships between providers and subscribers

### Cloud Security

* Problem with cloud security is what you are allowed to test and what should you test
* Another concern is if the hypervisor is compromised, all hosts on that hypervisor are as well
* Tools
  * Qualys Cloud Platform: end-to-end IT security solution
  * CloudPassage Halo: instant visibility and continuous protection for servers in any cloud
  * Core CloudInspect: pen-testing application for AWS EC2 users

#### Main Threats

* **Data Breach or Loss**: biggest thraet
* Abuse of Cloud Resources
* Insecure Interfaces and APIs
* Insufficient due diligence: moving an application without knowing the security differences
* Shared technology issues: multi-tenant environments that don't provide proper isolation
* Unknown risk profiles: subscribers simply don't know what security provisions are made in the background
* Others including malicious insiders, inadequate design and DDoS

#### Attacks

* **Service Hijacking**
  * Using Social Engineering Attacks
* * Using Networking Sniffing
* **Session Hijacking**
  * Using XSS Attack
  * Using Session Riding: basically CSRF
* **DNS Attacks**
  * DNS Poisoning
  * **Cybersquatting**: conducting phishing scams by registering a domain name that is similar to a cloud service provider
  * **Domain Hijacking**: stealing a cloud service provider's domain name
  * **Domain Snipping**: registering an elapsed/past domain name
* **Side Channel Attack** or **Cross-guest VM Breach**
  * Using an existing VM on the same physical host to attack another
  * This is more broadly defined as using something other than the direct interface to attack a system
* **SQL Injection Attack**: targeting SQL servers running vulnerable database applications
* **Cryptanalysis Attack**: weak or broken encryption, weak random number generation
* **Wrapping Attack**: SOAP message intercepted and data in envelope is changed and sent/replayed
* **DoS** and **DDoS Attack**
* **Man-in-the-Cloud \(MITC\) Attack**: carried out by abusing cloud file synchronization services, plants attacker's synchronization token on victim's drive to gain access of victim's files
