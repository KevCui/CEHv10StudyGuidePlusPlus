## Reconnaissance and Footprinting

* Looking for high-level information on a target

### Types of Footprinting

* **Active**: requiring attacker to touch the device or network
  * Social engineering and other communications that require interaction with target
* **Passive**: collecting information from publicly available sources
  * Websites, DNS records, business information databases
* **Anonymous**: information gathering without revealing anything about yourself
* **Pseudonymous**: making someone else take the blame for your actions

### Search Engines

* **Alexa.com**: resource for statistics about websites
* **NetCraft**: information about website and possibly OS info, used to discover restricted URLs
* **Job Search Sites**: information about technologies can be gleaned from job postings
* **Google**
  * filetype: look for file types
  * index of directory listings
  * info: contain Google's information about the page
  * intitle: string in title
  * inurl: string in url
  * link: find linked pages
  * related: find similar pages
  * site: find pages specific to that site
* **EDGAR**: database maintained by SEC and includes filing information from public companies
* **Shodan**: search engine that shows devices connected to the Internet
* **Whois**: obtain registration information for the domain

### Website Footprinting

* **Web mirroring**: allowing for discrete testing offline
  * HTTrack
  * Wget
  * WebRipper
  * Teleport Pro
  * Backstreet Browser
* **Archive.org**: providing cached websites from various dates which possibly have sensitive information that has been now removed
* **Web Spiders**: obtaining information from the website such as pages, etc.

### Email Footprinting

* **Email header**: may show servers and where the location of those servers are
* **Email tracking**: services can track various bits of information including the IP address of where it was opened, where it went, etc.

### DNS Footprinting

* Zone transfer replicates all records, happening when a primary server's serial number higher than the secondary's serial number
* **Name resolvers**: answering requests
* **Authoritative Servers**: holding all records for a namespace, where all records for a domain belonging to an organization or enterprise reside

#### Types of DNS Record

| Name | Description | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SRV | Service | Points to a specific service |
| SOA | Start of Authority | Indicates the authoritative NS for a namespace |
| PTR | Pointer | Maps an IP to a hostname |
| NS | Nameserver | Lists the nameservers for a namespace |
| MX | Mail Exchange | Lists email servers, low number high priority |
| CNAME | Canonical Name | Maps a name to an A reccord |
| A | Address | Maps an hostname to an IP address |
| AAAA | IPv6 address | Maps an hostname to an IPv6 address |

**SOA Record Fields**

* **Source Host**: hostname of the primary DNS
* **Contact Email**: email for the person responsible for the zone file
* **Serial Number**: revision number that increments with each change
* **Refresh Time**: time in which an update should occur
* **Retry Time**: time that a NS should wait on a failure
* **Expire Time**: time in which a zone transfer is allowed to complete
* **TTL** \(Time to Live\): minimum TTL for records within the zone

#### Regional Internet registtry \(RIR\)

* **AfriNIC**: Africa
* **APNIC**: Asia Pacific
* **ARIN**: North America
* **LACNIC**: Latin America
* **RIPE**: Europe, Middle East

#### nslookup

* Perform DNS queries: `nslookup [-options] [hostname]`
* Determine if the entry is present in DNS cache with option: `-norecursive`
* Provide the type of computer and OS a host: `set type=HINFO`
* Interactive zone transfer

```text
nslookup
server <IP Address>
set type = any
ls -d domainname.com
```

#### dig

* Unix-based command like nslookup
* `dig @server name type`

### Network Footprinting

* IP address range can be obtained from regional registrar
* Use traceroute to find intermediary servers
  * traceroute uses ICMP ECHO in Windows, hop count of 1
  * traceroute maps the route of a packet travel: manipulates the value of time to live \(TTL\) within packet to elicit a time exceeded in transit message
  * TTL is incremented by 1 for each hop discovered
* Windows command: `tracert`
* Linux command: `traceroute`

### OS Fingerprinting

* **Active**: sending crafted packets to the target
* **Passive**: sniffing network traffic for things such as TTL windows, DF \(Don't Fragment\) flags and ToS \(Type of Service\) fields

### Banner Grabbing

* Getting information about OS or specific server info \(such as web server, mail server, etc.\)
* **Active**: sending specially crafted packets and comparing responses to determine OS
* **Passive**: reading error messages, sniffing traffic or looking at page extensions

#### Telnet

* Easy way to banner grabbing, connects via telnet on port:

```text
telnet webserveraddress 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

#### Netcat

* `nc <IPaddress or FQDN> <port number>`

| Flag | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| -4 | IPv4 |
| -6 | IPv6 |
| -z | Report only open ports |
| -u | Scan for UDP ports |
| -l | Listen on a specific port |
| -w | Timeout seconds |
| -p | Specify source port |

### Other Tools

* **OSRFramework**: uses open source intelligence to get information about target
* **Metagoofil**: uses Google hacks to find information in meta tags
* **Maltego**: social Engineering Tools
