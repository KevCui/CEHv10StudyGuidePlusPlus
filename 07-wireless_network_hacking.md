### Wireless Encryption

#### WEP \(Wired Equivalent Privacy\)

* WEP doesn't effectively encrypt anything

**IV \(Initialization Vector\)**

* Used to calculate a 32-bit integrity check value \(ICV\)
* IVs are generally small and are frequently reused
* Sent in clear text as a part of the header, combined with RC4 makes it easy to decrypt the WEP key
* An attacker can send disassociate requests to the AP to generate a lot of these

#### WPA/WPA2 \(Wi-Fi Protected Access\)

* WPA uses TKIP \(Temporal Key Integrity Protocol\) with a 128-bit key
* WPA changes the key every 10,000 packets
* WPA transfers keys back and forth during an **Extensible Authentication Protocol** \(EAP\)
* WPA uses four-way handshake to derive keys
* **WPA2 Personal**: using a Pre-shared key \(PSK\) to authenticate, preconfigured password
* **WPA2 Enterprise**: can tie an EAP or RADIUS server into the authentication
* WPA2 ensures FIPS 140-2 compliance
* **Message Integrity Codes** \(MIC\): named MICHEAL, hashes for CCMP to protect integrity
* **Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code** \(CBC-MAC\): integrity process of WPA2

| Wireless Standard | Encryption | IV Size \(Bits\) | Key Length \(Bits\) | Integrity Check \(ICV\) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| WEP | RC4 | 24 | 40/104 | CRC-32 |
| WPA | RC4 + TKIP | 48 | 128 | MIC/CRC-32 |
| WPA2 | AES-CCMP | 48 | 128 | CBC-MAC \(CCMP\) |
